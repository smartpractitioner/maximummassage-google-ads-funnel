# Moments log — factory design pointer index

> **Purpose:** A one-liner index of notable moments captured during MH work. Used at Phase 7 warm-up to identify which moments deserve expansion into full artifacts under `docs/agent-contracts/<station>-notes.md`. This file is a POINTER, not the archive.
>
> **What counts as notable:** non-obvious reasoning, refusing to edit when the instinct was to edit, framework generalizing to a novel case, a misfire that was self-corrected, a decision where the "obvious" answer turned out to be wrong. Routine work does NOT log. Bar: "would future-me want to look this up?"
>
> **Format per entry:** `YYYY-MM-DD — [station/task] — one-sentence why-notable.` One line only. No expansion. If you feel the urge to add a second line, resist — the pointer is enough; the full context is recoverable via git + the referenced files at Phase 7 expansion time.
>
> **When to expand:** at Phase 7 (factory buildout) warm-up. Cross-reference each entry with the git commits from that date + the current state of relevant files, then expand the most useful pointers into full artifacts.

## Entries (newest at the bottom)

- 2026-07-03 — [editor / Phase 2 Step E on prenatal] — worker flagged maternity (top-5, 480/mo) coverage gap, applied semantic-match reasoning ("recognize the face across the room"), recommended leave-as-is, voluntarily generalized to antenatal — a clean example of the flag-for-review pattern working as designed. Full artifact: [editor-station-notes.md](editor-station-notes.md).
- 2026-07-03 — [editor / Phase 2 overall pass on prenatal] — refused to edit an already-shipped-good page rather than editing to earn keep; declared "no changes recommended" as the phase deliverable — a clean example of the assessment-first stance surviving the pull to make changes.
- 2026-07-03 — [privacy design / Decision 9 firewall pivot] — misdiagnosed the Decision 9 gap as "code refactor to add session_id in one sheet"; user-driven correction pushed to two physically separate Google Sheets as the real technical firewall (access control at storage level, not policy-only). Pattern: when a firewall depends on policy for enforcement, look for a way to make the storage architecture enforce it.
- 2026-07-03 — [privacy design / consent framework] — Alberta playbook from Claude web session integrated verbatim as factory-general SOP for AB non-regulated professions; DIY approach adopted over CMP evaluation at this scale; multi-jurisdiction expansion parked for Phase 7 as regime complexity grows.
- 2026-07-03 — [privacy design / discovered stale legal docs] — discovered public/privacy-policy/ and public/terms/ pages had been in the repo since April 2026 but were written for the Landingi/Tally-era funnel and never updated when architecture migrated to native quiz + Apps Script + Sheets. Reconciliation approach adopted (update existing docs, not from-scratch draft) + architecture-agnostic language pattern to avoid another rewrite cycle at Cloudflare migration. Meta-lesson: retrospective scans of prior artifacts should be scoped broadly, not just to the specific workstream being worked on.
- 2026-07-07 — [privacy design / factory reference material integrated] — Victor supplied two Feb 2026 Claude-web-session docs (Canadian multi-jurisdiction compliance + CMP comparison), converted to MD and saved as factory SOPs. Elevates Enzuzo as concrete top CMP choice for factory scale (Waterloo-based, $5/domain agency plan). Flags a consent model tension between the Alberta playbook (informed implied) and the multi-jurisdiction SOP (express consent) — jurisdictionally scoped, requires legal counsel adjudication for MH.
