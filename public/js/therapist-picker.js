Brookelyn focuses on building resilience and empowerment, helping active people understand their bodies, make a plan together, and get back to the things they love without recurring setbacks.

She’s especially passionate about postpartum recovery and women’s health, populations that are often underserved, and she’s deliberate about working without shame or "no pain, no gain" pressure, since lasting change comes from helping the body adapt, not pushing it past safe limits.',
