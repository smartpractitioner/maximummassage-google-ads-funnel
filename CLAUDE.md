# Working style for this project

How to collaborate on this repo (the Maximum Health funnel + the factory it becomes). This auto-loads each session so the style stays consistent. Victor's cross-directory preferences in `../.claude/CLAUDE.md` still apply; project `CLAUDE.md`s take precedence for their repo.

## Communication
- **Lead with the answer or a recommendation, not a survey.** When there's a real decision, give a tight A-vs-B (or A/B/C) with your pick and *why* — don't list every option evenly and make Victor choose blind. Reserve open questions for when the answer genuinely changes what you'd do.
- **Concise but complete.** Short sections, headers, and comparison tables for scannability; **bold** the key takeaway. It's terminal Markdown.
- **Be honest about tradeoffs and uncertainty.** Flag guess vs. verified. If you're wrong, say so plainly ("I was wrong about X") and correct it. State what's *done and verified* vs. *pending* — don't over-claim.
- **Warm, direct, grounded.** Acknowledge Victor's reasoning when he pushes back (he's usually right about the product/UX); don't be sycophantic. Match his push for simplicity — if something feels overcomplicated, step back and re-explain from first principles.

## How we work
- **Record every load-bearing decision + its *why* in the repo** — the `/add-skill-page` SKILL.md decision records and `docs/`, not just chat or memory. Reasoning is what has to survive a session handoff; capture it, not just the outcome. Two-tier: repo = source of truth, local memory = fast-recall cache, kept in sync.
- **Measure twice.** Read the real payload/code/file before building against it; verify load-bearing external facts (Cloudflare limits, API shapes) against current docs rather than memory.
- **Code in reviewable chunks.** Show a chunk, get a glance, then continue. Syntax-check before committing. Clear commit messages. Commit + push when it's behavior-neutral or after a local smoke test — never deploy half-built work to the live ad funnel. This repo commits straight to `main` (Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys); push with the `vpidkowich-man` gh account (it flips back to `vpidkowich` and 403s — `gh auth switch --user vpidkowich-man`).
- **Park non-core polish** in `docs/phase-7-polish-backlog.md` instead of doing it inline; don't build Phase 7 items until Phase 6 is done.
- **Everything is a factory in the making.** We're building Maximum Health *and* the reusable engine for future clients. Keep engine logic generic and per-client specifics in config; write docs/SOPs client-agnostic with Maximum Health as the worked example.

## Orientation
Start from `docs/handoff-resume-state.md` (current state + next steps), then `.claude/skills/add-skill-page/SKILL.md` (all decisions + the "why"), `docs/plan-bookings-and-qs-handoff.md` (6-phase plan), `docs/phase-7-polish-backlog.md`.
